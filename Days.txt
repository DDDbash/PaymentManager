Used react-table for creating the table

Day 3:
Create filters reducer
Removed react-table and created own table
Paginated table
Made sure that the searchbar worked for name and email (this was difficult due to having to render back to page 1
    when searching and useState was re-rendering the useEffect, so had to think a logic and dependency where the
    useEffect re-render worked with the useState re-render )
the payment status navbar works properly with proper css active classes
